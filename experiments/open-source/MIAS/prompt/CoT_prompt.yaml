  Question: Some friends discussed the sizes of their coin collections. What is the mean of the numbers?
  ## Return a query for the solution and answer with two keys: solution and answer. Respond using JSON only.

  {{'solution': "To find the mean, we sum up the numbers of coins for all the individuals and then divide the total by the number of individuals.
  Step 1: Add all the numbers of coins: 76 + 94 + 86 + 84 + 80 + 83 + 82 + 87 = 672
  Step 2: Count the number of individuals: There are 8 individuals.
  Step 3: Calculate the mean: Mean = Total sum of coins / Number of individuals = 672/8 = 84", 'answer': 84}}
  
  
  Read the following table and then write solution texts to answer a question:
  
  | Price  | Quantity demanded | Quantity supplied |
  |--------|-------------------|-------------------|
  | $155   | 22,600            | 5,800            |

  Question: Look at the table. Then answer the question. At a price of $155, is there a shortage or a surplus?
  ## Return a query for the solution and answer with two keys: solution and answer. Respond using JSON only.

  {{'solution': "To determine if there is a 'shortage' or a 'surplus', we compare the 'quantity demanded' and the 'quantity supplied' at the given price.
  Step 1: 
  Identify the values from the table for $155:
  - Quantity demanded = 22,600
  - Quantity supplied = 5,800
  Step 2: 
  Calculate the difference: 
  Shortage or Surplus = Quantity demanded - Quantity supplied = 22,600 - 5,800 = 16,800
  Step 3: Determine the situation: 
  Since the quantity demanded is greater than the quantity supplied, there is a 'shortage' of 16,800 units.", 'answer': 'shortage'}}

  Question: Samir's class recorded how many cans of food each student collected for their canned food drive. What is the median of the numbers?
  ## Return a query for the solution and answer with two keys: solution and answer. Respond using JSON only.

  {{'solution': "To find the median, we need to arrange the numbers in order from smallest to largest and then identify the middle number.
  Step 1: Arrange the numbers: 4, 7, 7, 8, 9
  Step 2: Identify the middle number. Since there are 5 numbers (an odd count), the middle number is the third number. So the median is 7.", 'answer': 7}}

  Question: Lorenzo has $13.50. Does he have enough to buy a toy guitar and a set of juggling balls?
  ## Return a query for the solution and answer with two keys: solution and answer. Respond using JSON only.
  
  {{'solution': "To determine if Lorenzo can afford both the toy guitar and the set of juggling balls, we need to calculate their combined cost and compare it to Lorenzo's available money.
  Step 1: Identify the prices:
  - Toy guitar = $8.23  
  - Set of juggling balls = $5.01  
  Step 2: Calculate the total cost:
  Total cost = 8.23 + 5.01 = 13.24
  Step 3: Compare the total cost to Lorenzo's money. Lorenzo has $13.50, and the total cost is $13.24. Since $13.24 is less than $13.50, Lorenzo does have enough money.", 'answer': 'Yes'}}
