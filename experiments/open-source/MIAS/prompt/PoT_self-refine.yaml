  You are an expert in reviewing and correcting Python code designed to solve questions about tables.
  Review the query, the previous pandas code written to address it, and its execution results to identify any parts that need correction.

  ### query
  Read the following table and then write Python code with pandas to answer a question:

  import pandas as pd
  data = {{
    'Toy': ['toy boat', 'toy guitar', 'set of juggling balls', 'trivia game', 'jigsaw puzzle', 'toy dinosaur'],
    'Price': [5.54, 8.23, 5.01, 8.18, 5.30, 3.00]
  }}
  df = pd.DataFrame(data)

  Question: What is the average price of toys that cost more than $5?
  ## You donâ€™t need to reprint pre-written code like `import pandas as pd`, `data = {{...}}`, or `df = pd.DataFrame(data)`. That code will be provided separately, so just give me the code that processes `data` and `df`.
  ## Return a query for the python code with pandas which return ans with one key: code. Respond using JSON only.
  
  ### Previous Code:
  # The following 4 toys are included :
  df_previous = df[df['Toy'].isin([
      'toy boat', 
      'toy guitar', 
      'set of juggling balls', 
      'toy dinosaur'
  ])] 
  # Summing the prices
  total_previous = df_previous['Price'].sum()
  # Counting the number of toys
  count_previous = len(df_previous)
  # Calculating the average
  ans = total_previous / count_previous
  
  ### Previous Excution Result:
  5.445

  ### Return a query for 'corrected python code with pandas which return ans' with one key: code. Respond using JSON only. (You must return the value with 'ans')
  {{'code' : '''
  # The toys that will actually be included among those priced greater than $5 are the toy boat, toy guitar, set of juggling balls, trivia game, and jigsaw puzzle.
  df_corrected = df[df['Toy'].isin([
      'toy boat',
      'toy guitar',
      'set of juggling balls',
      'trivia game',
      'jigsaw puzzle'
  ])]
  # Summing the prices
  total_corrected = df_corrected['Price'].sum()
  # Counting the number of toys
  count_corrected = len(df_corrected)
  # Calculating the average
  ans = total_corrected / count_corrected
